Real-time Impermanent Loss Calculation in Telegram Bot

This document provides an overview of the script designed to calculate the impermanent loss (IL) of liquidity provider (LP) positions in real-time using the CoinGecko API within a Telegram Bot. Unlike traditional financial calculators, this script facilitates interaction via a Telegram Bot interface, providing on-the-go accessibility and ease of use.

Script Overview

The script utilizes the pycoingecko library to fetch real-time cryptocurrency prices, and the python-telegram-bot library to interact with users through a Telegram bot. It calculates the impermanent loss incurred in a two-token liquidity pool based on changes in the quantity of the tokens and their price fluctuations.

Key Components

1. Price Fetching:

get_price(crypto_name): Fetches the current price of a cryptocurrency in USD from the CoinGecko API.

2.	Telegram Bot Interaction:

The bot provides a menu-driven interface to input the details of the user’s LP position, including the names and quantities of the tokens before and after the price change, and any farmed commission.

3. Impermanent Loss Calculation:

calculate_il(): Calculates the impermanent loss based on the provided data 

Usage Workflow

Starting the Bot:

1. A user starts the bot using the /start command, which presents a menu with options to calculate impermanent loss or to navigate back.

2. Entering LP Position Details:
	•	The user selects the “IL Calc” option and enters the details of the LP position:
	•	Names of Token1 and Token2.
	•	Quantities of each token before and after the price change.
	•	Any additional commission earned from farming.

3. Calculation and Display:

After all inputs are provided, the script calculates the impermanent loss and displays the result directly in the Telegram chat.

Deployment and Environment Setup

Dependencies:

	•	Python packages: telegram, pycoingecko, python-telegram-bot.
	•	A valid Telegram Bot Token set in the config.py file.
	•	Running the Bot:
	•	The script is executed on a server or a local machine where Python is installed.
	•	Use the command python <script_name>.py to start the bot.
	•	Security and Error Handling:
	•	Error handling is integrated to manage API failures or incorrect user inputs.
	•	Ensure secure handling of the bot token and robust exception handling to maintain operational integrity.

Conclusion

This Telegram Bot script offers a dynamic and user-friendly approach to tracking impermanent loss for cryptocurrency liquidity providers. By leveraging real-time data from the CoinGecko API, it provides valuable financial insights directly through a Telegram interface, making it accessible for users on mobile devices or desktops.
