DeFiLama Pools Rating Script

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the DeFiLama Pools Rating script, which is designed to calculate and optimize investment strategies for DeFi protocols using data from DeFiLama. Unlike the VenRatTelegramBot, this script employs the Lindy Effect across all its calculations, influencing the ratings of pools, tokens, and protocols.

Script Overview

The DeFiLama Pools Rating script operates in a back-end environment without a front-end interface, necessitating manual execution via command-line scripts. The user must manually maintain the pools.csv, protocols.csv, and tokens.csv files, ensuring they are populated with data using specific naming conventions derived from DeFiLama (e.g., https://defillama.com/protocol/lido for the Lido Protocol).

Key Components

	1.defilama_request.js:

Purpose: Manages the loading of data from CSV files, updates ratings based on API responses, and recalculates strategic ratings using the Lindy Effect.

Functionality:

Updates pool, protocol, and token ratings.

Calculates strategy ratings using a formula that integrates token ratings, protocol ratings, ROI of pools, and the Lindy Effect to compute the venture ratings.
	
2.	allocation.py:

Purpose: Optimizes the allocation of investments across various protocols based on the strategy ratings calculated by defilama_request.js.

Functionality:

Loads protocol data from pools.csv.
Calculates and normalizes risk scores.
Defines optimization constraints and bounds for weight allocations.
Saves the optimized allocation summary to allocation_summary.csv.

Detailed Workflow

Data Preparation:

Populate pools.csv, protocols.csv, and tokens.csv with relevant data from DeFiLama, adhering to their naming conventions.

Running the Scripts:

Execute defilama_request.js to fetch data updates and recalculate ratings:

node defilama_request.js

This script processes the data, updates ratings using the Lindy Effect, and recalculates strategy ratings, saving the results in CSV files.

Allocation Optimization:

Run allocation.py to compute the optimal allocation of funds based on the updated strategy ratings:

python allocation.py

The script outputs allocation_summary.csv, which details the dollar allocation and weight percentage for each protocol.


Files and Data Management

pools.csv, protocols.csv, tokens.csv: Users must manually add or update entries. The scripts read from these files to perform updates and calculations.

Output Files:

pools.csv: Updated with recalculated strategy ratings.

allocation_summary.csv: Contains the final allocation summary with detailed investment percentages and amounts for each protocol.

Conclusion

The DeFiLama Pools Rating script provides a robust backend solution for managing and optimizing DeFi investments based on comprehensive data analysis and the Lindy Effect. Users must ensure accurate data entry and regular script execution to maintain up-to-date investment strategies. This script stands out by providing a deeper, theory-driven approach to rating and allocation, distinct from other tools like VenRatTelegramBot.
